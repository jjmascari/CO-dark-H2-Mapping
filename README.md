# CO-dark Hâ‚‚ Map Generator

This repository contains Python code for generating **CO-dark molecular hydrogen (Hâ‚‚)** maps of nearby galaxies using dust, HI, and CO observations.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to identify regions of **molecular hydrogen not traced by CO emission**â€”commonly referred to as **CO-dark Hâ‚‚**â€”by combining multi-wavelength astronomical data and aligning them onto a common coordinate system.

### Includes:

- Reading in FITS-format maps of dust, HI, and CO
- Reprojecting all maps to the same **WCS (World Coordinate System)**
- Creating **radial profiles** for analysis
